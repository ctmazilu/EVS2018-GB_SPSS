## Reseach Question

**Research Question**: Is there a relationship between perceived quality of democratic political system and perceived women rights compared to men.

## Rationale

Why is this question sociologically relevant and interesting? 

This question will answer if the quality of the democratic political system influences equal rights between men and women. This is sociologically interesting because it answers two fundamental aspects of society, gender, and politics. It seeks to understand whether democracy benefits gender equality. Sociology of gender and Political Sociology are interesting and relevant fields.

The level of gender equality could be seen as a measure of a democracy’s quality. Democracies that uphold equal rights for all citizens, regardless of gender, may be considered ‘better’ or effective.

It must be kept in mind that the data is not inclusive of all gender identity, and this could be explored in further collection of data (i.e. does perceived quality of democratic political system influence if trans/non-binary people have the same (perceived) rights as men and women.). This research question can strengthen our understanding of political systems as a social institution with large capabilities for social change.

## Hypothesis 
Both variables are *ordinal* therefore a *crosstabulation* will be conducted. It could go both ways, democracy could influence womenrights;womenrights could influence democracy.

>**Independent variable:** democracy 
>**Dependent variable:** womenrightsRecode

**Null Hypothesis H0:** There is no significant relationship between perceived quality of democratic political system and perceived women rights compared to men.
**Alternative Hypothesis H1:** There is a significantrelationshipbetweenperceivedqualityofdemocratic political system and perceived women rights compared to men.

## Data Description
I am using EVS2018-GB.sav (EVS, 2020), the unit of analysis is ‘individuals’ in Great Britain. The sample size of the data set is 1788.
There are 181 variables (including 4 variables which have been recoded for this exercise and others) 

## Variable description 

Variable Name: democracy (variable 122),
Variable label: Political system: Having a democratic political system Level of Measurement: Ordinal
Value Label: (negative values are not used in the analysis) 

### Table 1

| Value | Label         |
|-------|---------------|
| 1     | Very Good     |
| 2     | Fairly Good   |
| 3     | Fairly Bad    |
| 4     | Very Bad      |


Variable Name: womenrights (variable 130)
Variable Label: Democracy: Women have the same rights as men. Level of Measurement: Ordinal
Value Label: (negative values are not used in the analysis) Old Valyes

## Recoded Variables
Variable Name: womenrightsRecode:
Variable Label: Democracy: Women have the same rights as men. Is this a essential characteristic of democracy?
Level of Measurement: Ordinal Value Label:

I did not recode democracy due to the variables already capturing the essential data points necessary to conduct a bivariate analysis.
I have recoded the variable womenrights into womenrightsRecode. I decided to recode the 10 categories into 5 categories (Not essential, Somewhat essential,
Moderately essential, Very essential, An essential characteristic). This was done to give a more concise view of the answers, however not distilling it into too few categories which would lose nuance.

### Table 2

| Value | Label                                                         | New | Label                                      |
