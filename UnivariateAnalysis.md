### Descriptive narrative for democracy

A table for descriptive statistics for democracy was produced, shown in Table 6.3. The descriptive statistics calculate the measures of central tendency for the ordinal variable. The Median of people think they have a ‘very good’ democratic political system (Value label=1). The Mode of people believe that they live in a ‘very good’ democratic political system (Value label=1). 
The measure of dispersion was produced in Table 6.3 and Table 6.4. The range is 4, shown in Table 6.3. A frequency table was produced, Table 6.4, shows that most respondents 65.2% (n=1134) answered a ‘very good’, followed by 29% (n=507) who said, ‘fairly good”. Only 4.6% (n=80) and 1.1% (n=20) said ‘fairly bad’ and ‘very bad’ respectively.
The graphical representation for democracy in Figure 6.2 was presented in a Bar Chart with percentages.
