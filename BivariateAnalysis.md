# Bivariate Analysis

Crosstabulation was produced because the independent variable is ordinal and the dependent variable is ordinal, 
thus best fit for bivariate analysis is crosstabulation. Recoding of womenrights was undertaken for bivariate analysis to give a more concise view of the answers,
however not distilling it into too few categories which would lose nuance.
